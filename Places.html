            <p> After a four hour flight from Hong Kong, I was finally in Phuket, Thailand. I was so exicted because it was my first time going to a new country. I've always heard great things about Thailand but never had the chance to go until now. Although my plane arrived around 2am, I was wide awake.  </p>

            <p> After what seemed like hours waiting to get through the gates, I finally made it through. Before leaving for my hotel, I made sure to exchange some money at the airport. I still had some leftover Taiwanese dollars from my study abroad in Taiwan, so I went ahead and exchanged that...</p>

           

            <h2 class="section-heading">Summer in Taiwan </h2>
             <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Taipei101.jpg" alt="Taipei101">
            </a>

            <p> Summer of 2017 has to be one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. I was selected to study abroad at National Taiwan University through my Chinese Flagship Program. The program is named ICLP which is a rigorous three months study opportunity for students to improve their Mandarin abilities </p>

            <p> My mother previously went to Taiwan when one of my younger sisters taught english to kids over there for the summer. When they came back from their trip, I head nothing but good things, so when I received my acceptance letter, I was ever so excited.  </p>

            <p> Throughout the months that I studied in Taiwan, I have not only learned about an entirely new culture, but also gained some unforgettable memories. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Temples Galore! </h2>

            <p>Temples were one of the most frequently sighted buildings in Taiwan. The reason being, according to one of my Chinese teachers, because Taiwan is an island, the waters that surround it can sometimes get very violent. Therefore, in the past many sailors would visit temples in order to make a prayer before going out to sea. </p>

            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">One example of the many temples from Taiwan </span>

            <p>One of my favorite temples that I remember visiting is the Long shan temple (龙山寺). The temple had a beautiful waterful in the front yard, and it was close to a night market. </p>

            <p>If you ever get the chance to travel to Taiwan, definitely make Long Shan Temple a must see on your to do list! </p>
